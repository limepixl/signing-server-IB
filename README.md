smrt

Eooo, Eooo... I have no magic lamp
Eooo, Eooo... I believe in fairytales
Eooo, Eooo... But I have a magic song, I call it "Eooo"
 
I had some tea in England,
In Italy I ate Pizza,
In Paris I saw the Eiffel Tower,
Then the leaning tower of Pisa.
 
The journey took me all the way
To Germany and Norway
To China, Russia, Cyprus
To Belarus and Belgium
 
Eooo Eooo,Čiribа, čiriba, čiribu
Eooo Eooo,Čiribа, čiriba, čiribu
This song is magical, it takes me far away
But I always come back home no matter what they say
 
Eooo Eooo,Čiribа, čiriba, čiribu
Eooo Eooo,Čiribа, čiriba, čiribu
This song is magical, it takes me far away
